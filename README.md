# StopIt
StopIt is an Android and Web based app designed to catch and stop bullying in school at an earlier stage. Students can take pictures and videos of their peers being bullied using their smartphones. Our smart face detection system is linked to the school directory which automatically finds who the bully is. All of this information is then condensed and sent to the admin in a fluid and elegant web view. The students also have the freedom to add a caption to help describe what happened during the event.
